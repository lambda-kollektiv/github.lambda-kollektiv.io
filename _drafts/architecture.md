While we were first focusing only on Clojure and Clojurescript as primary language for this project, we realized that it is also useful for personal growth to refresh and to expand our skills in other web languages. Therefore we will now use Javascript at full stack as the language of our choice.

## Backend
As backend system, [https://nodejs.org/](node.js) is a good candidate as its package manager provides a variety of useful libraries where we will use [http://expressjs.com/](express) as our web framework.

## Frontend
The UI design described in our previous [https://lambda-kollektiv.github.io/2015/07/29/haushalt_design/](post) has multiple widgets that are best represented in a modular way. Hence, our choice for the frontend framework is a combination of [https://facebook.github.io/react/](React) and [https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/](immutable).

Hopefully this combination of frameworks gives us an overview of modern web technologies.
